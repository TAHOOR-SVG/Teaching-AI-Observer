# Teaching-AI-Observer

This project is a teaching-based web application designed to help analyze and evaluate the clarity of teachers’ voice recordings or uploaded videos. It provides automated feedback on speech clarity, speed, and overall audio quality. Due to end-semester examinations, the project is currently incomplete and will be updated with additional features and improvements in future versions.

Note: This teaching-analysis project is still incomplete due to end-semester exams, and more features will be added soon.
